It has been a while again and it is time for a new post. This time again with Haxe. I was working lately on a library mainly used for games wrapping the webgl api and other browser js api into a potentially crossplatform api. The main interesting part from it was its use of a type safe wrapper arround glsl shaders.
It served me well and it was the first thing I wanted to port to my new destination : Kha.

I have heard of Kha before the WWX2015 but did not bother try another framework. I had already a far better idea : write my own :D

but this was untill I attended Robert's speech and dived in Kha.
